# Meal-Planner-App (Front-End)

A web application for creating and organzing daily or weekly meal plans with nutritional summary and grocery list outputs. You can create an ingredient, assemble those ingredients into a meal and then select meals for daily meal plans which can be organized into a weekly meal plan. 

Since you receive a grocery list of all ingredients in your meal plan as the output, you are encouraged to make an ingredient any item that can be purchased at a grocery store. The overall goal is for you to plan/organize your meals and make it easier to purchase all necessary ingredients for the week.

Taking it one step further in meal planning, nutritional information is available for each meal, daily meal plan and weekly meal plan. This way you can see the nutritional value of a meal, the total for a day and the total and daily average for a week.

Technologies include Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, React.js frontend. Bootstrap is used for styling on the front-end and the Pony gem is used to allow you to email yourself the grocery list for your meal plans. (Texting functionality using Twilio gem is included but commented out in the code).
