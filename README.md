# Meal-Planner-App (Front-End)

A web application for creating and organzing weekly meal plans with nutritional summary and grocery list outputs. 

The back-end for this application can be found here: https://github.com/ricardoidelgado/meal-planner-api

## Background

I wanted to find a way to plan out my meals for the week and receive a grocery list with all ingredients for each meal. As I thought through the idea, I saw the value in adding the nutrional information for each ingredient which would allow you to have a nutritional summary on a daily and weekly basis.
